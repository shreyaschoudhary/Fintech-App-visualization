# Fintech-App-visualization
Fintech team is building an app that shares stocks and ETFs prices and visualizes them for the clients. As an alternative to the typical time-series plots (time vs stock/ETF price), you are suggesting to use PCA in order to create a simplified visualization of the past performance of a stock/ETF.
PCA is done on the data and data is visualized through Bokeh Plots in Python.
